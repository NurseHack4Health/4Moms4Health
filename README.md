# 4Moms4Health
The U.S. has a major problem and is considered last in developed countries when it comes to maternal morbidity and mortality. I would like to see a team develop an app for pregnant women to have a source to help them know what is available to them in their geographic location for seeking care, social work assistance to get them there, and virtual assistance when needed for early intervention to promote better outcomes. This would put in the users hands all that they need to communicate with providers and encourage early prenatal care.

# Features that we are building
- Entry form for patient health information: 
- A chat bot to enter symptoms and receive recommendations, and the ability to to speak with a live caregiver.
- Educational information on all stages of pregnancy care.
- A map to locate nearby care facilities.
