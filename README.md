The U.S. has a major problem and is considered last in developed countries when it comes to maternal morbidity and mortality. I would like to see a team develop an app for pregnant women to have a source to help them know what is available to them in their geographic location for seeking care, social work assistance to get them there, and virtual assistance when needed for early intervention to promote better outcomes. This would put in the users hands all that they need to communicate with providers and encourage early prenatal care.

Meet the team
