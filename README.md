# 4Moms4Health
The U.S. has a major problem and is considered last in developed countries when it comes to maternal morbidity and mortality. I would like to see a team develop an app for pregnant women to have a source to help them know what is available to them in their geographic location for seeking care, social work assistance to get them there, and virtual assistance when needed for early intervention to promote better outcomes. This would put in the users hands all that they need to communicate with providers and encourage early prenatal care.

# Motivation
Our freely available app helps overcome barriers to perinatal care such as socio-economic status, access to healthcare facilities, education, and cultural taboos.

# Features that we are building
Included in this repository is a packaged PowerApp solution that can be configured with custom data sources.

Features include:

- Health tracking using data entry forms to enter vital signs information, medical history, and symptoms.
- A chat bot to enter symptoms and receive recommendations, and the ability to obtain live support.
- Educational and motivational information on all stages of pregnancy care.
- A map to locate nearby care facilities.
